Lecture 7 Project 4 I used Django, SQLite, HTML, and CSS to create a mini social media. In this app one can create a profile, loggin, loggout, post, comment on posts,
follow/unfollow users, like posts, and had 3 sections for profile, timeline, and follower timeline. CRUD was used heavily in my Django models.

This is only a jist of my technical experience
